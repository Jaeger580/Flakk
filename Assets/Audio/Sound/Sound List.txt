List Name | Invisioned Use | Notes

Button Bad | Negative sound for interaction with UI elements |
Button Good | Positive sound for interaction with UI elements |
Death Warn... | Used to game over, beeps start, when beeps finish an explosion is heard, cut to black during explosion part |
Deep Clank 1 | Not sure, maybe we can use this for when the reloading starts? | On reload, play this sound once then move onto Fast Clanks
Delayed Explosion | Used for when a weakpoint dies | We don't have this functionality so just play it when the mothership loses 25% health
Distance Explosion | Play on enemy death |
Factory Exterior | Ironically, play this inside the gunnery room where the player can interact with our consoles | Play at low volume!
Fast Clanks 1 | Use this sound for EVERY bullet reloaded | Make sure when layering this sound it's played moltible times, not stopped then started again, we want to hear the clicks BE faster when our reload is fast |
Security Alarm | This is just a non-edited version of the death beeps, use wherever, maybe play as a sound for entering/exit gun as a PH?
Short Beep Tone | An Extra Interaction beep use for UI interactions 
Shotgun Fire 1 | Used for the main gun fireing sound | Just like Fast Clanks, make sure this sound is played each time you fire, not just reset. Also keep the volume low for now!
Shotgun Fire Post | Played AFTER gun fireing sound, OR when hitting an enemy, ill let you decide :)


FOOTSTEPS FOLDER: There's about 7 seperated footsteps in here, play them randomly with a min delay when walking around the gunnery as the player
